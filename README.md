# Aquous-Solubility-Prediction

Aqueous solubility is important steps for drug discovery, Material Science, Environmental studies because each chemical compound solubility depends on its Descriptors using various machine learning models and ensemble techniques.

Motivation:

Building Machine Learning Model that accurately predicts the solubility of chemical compounds. This high-precision approach is designed to address the critical challenges in drug discovery.
